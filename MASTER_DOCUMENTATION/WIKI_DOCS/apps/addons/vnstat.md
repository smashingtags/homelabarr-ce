# vnStat

vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the network
interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This
means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures
light use of system resources regardless of network traffic rate.

By default, traffic statistics are stored on a five minute level for the last
48 hours, on a hourly level for the last 4 days, on a daily level for the
last 2 full months and on a yearly level forever. The data retention durations
are fully user configurable. Total seen traffic and a top days listing is also
provided. Optional png image output is available in systems with the gd library
installed.

See the [official webpage](https://humdi.net/vnstat/) for additional details
and output examples.
