# Architecture

!!! info "Who this page is for"
    Developers, contributors, and curious people who want to understand how HomelabARR works under the hood. **If you just want to use HomelabARR, you can skip this entirely** — the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) and [Web Dashboard](web-dashboard.md) guides have everything you need.

    If you're adding custom app templates, [CLI Bridge](cli-bridge.md) is the relevant page.
    If you want to contribute code, start with [Contributing](contributing.md).

## The Big Picture

HomelabARR is two containers working together:

![System Architecture — shows the Browser, Frontend (nginx + React on port 8084), Backend (Node.js + Express on port 8092), CLI Bridge (reads app YAML templates), Docker SDK (talks to the host Docker socket), and the Deployed Apps. Data flows from Browser → Frontend → Backend → Docker → running containers.](../img/diagrams/system-architecture.png)

- **Frontend** (port 8084) — a React app served by nginx. This is what you see in your browser. It proxies all API calls to the backend via nginx.
- **Backend** (port 8092) — a Node.js/Express server. It reads app templates, talks to Docker, handles authentication (JWT + API keys), and streams deployment output to your browser in real time via SSE.
- **App templates** — standard Docker Compose YAML files in the `apps/` folder. The backend reads them; you deploy them with one click. See [CLI Bridge](cli-bridge.md) for how they work.

## How Deployment Works

![Deployment Flow — six steps: (1) Click Deploy in the browser, (2) Backend loads YAML template, (3) Transform template for chosen mode (Standard strips Traefik labels; Traefik mode keeps them + adds proxy network; Authelia mode adds chain-authelia middleware), (4) docker compose up -d, (5) Backend streams Docker output via SSE, (6) Container is running.](../img/diagrams/deployment-flow.png)

When you click Deploy, here's what happens:

1. You pick an app and a mode (Standard, Traefik, or Traefik + Authelia)
2. Frontend sends a request to the backend: "deploy Plex in standard mode"
3. Backend loads the Plex YAML template from `apps/media-servers/plex.yml`
4. Backend transforms the template for the chosen mode (see [CLI Bridge](cli-bridge.md) for details)
5. Fills in your settings (timezone, data path, user ID, etc.)
6. Runs `docker compose up -d`
7. Streams Docker output back to your browser in real time
8. Container is running

## Network Modes

![Network Topology — Standard mode: Browser → App (direct port, bridge network). Traefik mode: Browser → Traefik (443, proxy network) → App. Authelia mode: Browser → Traefik → Authelia (auth check) → App. Docker socket connects the Backend to all running containers.](../img/diagrams/network-topology.png)

**Standard:** App binds to a port. You access it at `http://server:PORT`. No setup required, works immediately.

**Traefik:** App joins the `proxy` network. Traefik reads Docker labels and routes by hostname with automatic SSL. You get URLs like `https://jellyfin.yourdomain.com`.

**Traefik + Authelia:** Same as Traefik, but Authelia sits between Traefik and your app — requiring login with optional two-factor authentication before anyone can reach the container.

## Where Data Lives

```
/opt/appdata/           # Your apps' data (configs, databases, media indexes)
├── plex/
├── radarr/
├── sonarr/
└── ...

homelabarr-data/        # Docker volume — HomelabARR settings (users, sessions)
```

Back up `/opt/appdata/` and you've covered everything important.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, shadcn/ui, Vite |
| Backend | Node.js, Express |
| Container management | Docker SDK (via socket) |
| Authentication | JWT tokens + `hlr_` API keys |
| Deployment streaming | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
| Container images | [LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io) + official images |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions → GitHub Container Registry |

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

```
feature/* → dev branch → staging branch (1-week soak) → main branch
```

When code merges to `main`, GitHub Actions:
1. Builds multi-arch Docker images (amd64 + arm64)
2. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/smashingtags/`)
3. Deploys the wiki to GitHub Pages

If you run HomelabARR with Watchtower, it auto-pulls new images when they're published.

## Contributing

Want to add an app template, fix a bug, or improve the docs? See [Contributing](contributing.md) for the workflow. The short version: fork the repo, create a `feature/*` branch, deploy to dev to test, then open a PR against `staging`.
